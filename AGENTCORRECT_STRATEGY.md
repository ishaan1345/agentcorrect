# AgentCorrect: Learning Guardrails Strategy

## The Vision

Fork NeMo Guardrails and add **learning from corrections** to create the first guardrails system that gets smarter over time.

## Current NeMo Guardrails (Static)
```python
# Rules are hardcoded in Colang files
rails:
  - input:
      - block toxic content
      - check for jailbreaks
  - output:
      - filter inappropriate responses
      - ensure factual accuracy
```

## AgentCorrect (Dynamic Learning)
```python
# Rules are learned from corrections
rails:
  - input:
      - apply learned input corrections
      - check confidence before proceeding
  - output:
      - apply learned output corrections
      - capture human fixes for learning
  - execution:
      - correct parameters based on past failures
      - add missing fields (idempotency keys, etc.)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fork and Extend (Week 1)
1. Fork NeMo Guardrails
2. Add `LearningRail` base class
3. Add correction database
4. Add pattern learning engine

### Phase 2: Correction Capture (Week 2)
1. Add correction capture middleware
2. Browser extension for Gmail/Docs corrections
3. Git hook for code corrections
4. Slack bot for message corrections

### Phase 3: Learning Rails (Week 3)
1. `InputLearningRail` - Learn input transformations
2. `OutputLearningRail` - Learn output corrections
3. `ExecutionLearningRail` - Learn API call fixes
4. `DialogLearningRail` - Learn conversation patterns

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 4)
1. LangChain integration
2. OpenAI function calling integration
3. AutoGen integration
4. CrewAI integration

## Key Differentiators from NeMo

| NeMo Guardrails | AgentCorrect |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Static rules | Dynamic learning |
| Manual configuration | Automatic from corrections |
| Generic for all users | Personalized per operator |
| Same rules forever | Improves daily |
| Prevents bad outputs | Corrects to good outputs |

## Technical Architecture

```python
class LearningRail:
    """Base class for all learning rails."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.corrections = CorrectionDatabase()
        self.patterns = PatternLearner()
        
    async def process(self, value: Any, context: Dict) -> Any:
        # Check if we have a learned correction
        if correction := self.find_correction(value, context):
            value = self.apply_correction(value, correction)
            
        # Let it through
        result = await self.next_rail(value, context)
        
        # Capture any human correction
        if human_fix := await self.detect_correction(result):
            self.learn(value, human_fix, context)
            
        return result
```

## Business Model

### Open Source Core
- Basic learning rails
- Local correction storage
- Single-user learning

### Enterprise Edition
- Team correction sharing
- Cross-company learning network
- Compliance reporting
- SLA guarantees

### Pricing
- Open Source: Free
- Team (10 users): $999/month
- Enterprise: $10K+/month
- Network Access: $50K+/year

## Go-to-Market

### Week 1-4: Build MVP
- Fork NeMo Guardrails
- Add basic learning rail
- Test with Stripe idempotency

### Week 5-8: Early Adopters
- 10 companies using AI agents
- Track correction patterns
- Show 90% error reduction

### Week 9-12: Launch
- ProductHunt launch
- "Learning Guardrails" category creation
- Case studies from early adopters

### Month 4+: Scale
- Integration marketplace
- Correction pattern marketplace
- Enterprise features

## Why This Wins

1. **Built on proven foundation** - NeMo is production-ready
2. **Solves real problem** - Agents fail, humans correct, we learn
3. **Network effects** - Every user makes it better
4. **Unique approach** - No one else doing learning guardrails
5. **Clear monetization** - Enterprises pay for reliability

## Next Steps

1. Complete forking setup
2. Build first LearningRail
3. Test with real agent failures
4. Get first customer
5. Iterate based on feedback

## The Outcome

**6 months from now:** AgentCorrect is the standard way to make AI agents reliable, with thousands of companies contributing corrections that benefit everyone.

**The tagline:** "Guardrails that learn from every mistake."
