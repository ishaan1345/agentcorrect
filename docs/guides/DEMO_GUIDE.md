# 🚀 AgentCorrect Demo Guide

## One-Line Install & Demo

```bash
# Install and run demo in one command:
pip install agentcorrect && agentcorrect demo --scenario all
```

## What You'll See

The demo will show AgentCorrect catching 3 real disasters:

1. **💳 Payment Disaster** - Stripe charge without safety key (could charge 50x)
2. **🗄️ Database Disaster** - SQL DELETE that would wipe all users
3. **📧 Privacy Disaster** - Sending data to unapproved domain

## The Complete Demo Experience

### Step 1: See What AI Agents Can Break

```bash
# Create a file with real agent disasters:
cat > disasters.jsonl << 'EOF'
{"trace_id": "1", "role": "http", "meta": {"http": {"method": "POST", "url": "https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges", "headers": {}, "body": {"amount": 9999}}}}
{"trace_id": "2", "role": "sql", "meta": {"sql": {"query": "DELETE FROM users WHERE 1=1"}}}
{"trace_id": "3", "role": "redis", "meta": {"redis": {"command": "FLUSHALL"}}}
EOF
```

### Step 2: Run AgentCorrect

```bash
agentcorrect analyze disasters.jsonl --out results/
```

### Step 3: See Beautiful Output

🚨 SEV0 - Critical Issues (CI/CD Blockers):
--------------------------------------------------
❌ Missing payment idempotency — 1 operations
   Fix: Add idempotency keys to payment POST requests
❌ SQL DELETE without WHERE clause — 1 query
   Fix: Add WHERE clause to DELETE queries
❌ Redis FLUSHALL detected — 1 command
   Fix: Remove FLUSHALL commands

## Understanding the Value

### Without AgentCorrect:
- **Day 1**: AI agent accidentally charges customer 50 times → $50,000 in refunds
- **Day 2**: AI agent deletes user database → Business dead
- **Day 3**: There is no Day 3

### With AgentCorrect:
- **Every Day**: Disasters blocked before they happen
- **Cost**: $0 in damages
- **Sleep**: Peaceful

## Real-World Example

```python
# Your AI agent's code (simplified):
def process_payment(customer, amount):
    # Agent forgets the safety key!
    stripe.charge(customer, amount)  # ❌ DANGEROUS
    
    # If network hiccup, agent retries...
    stripe.charge(customer, amount)  # ❌ CHARGED TWICE!
    stripe.charge(customer, amount)  # ❌ CHARGED 3 TIMES!

# With AgentCorrect watching:
# 🛡️ BLOCKED: "Missing idempotency key"
# 💰 Customer saved from triple charge
```

## How It Works (Simple Version)

```
Your AI Agent → Makes Decision → AgentCorrect Checks → Only Safe Actions Pass
        ↓              ↓                  ↓                      ↓
   "Charge $100"  "No safety key?"  "BLOCK! ❌"          "Nothing happens"
   "Delete all"   "WHERE 1=1?"      "BLOCK! ❌"          "Database saved"
   "Charge $50"   "Has safety key?"  "PASS ✅"           "Payment processed"
```

## Try These Commands

```bash
# See all scenarios:
agentcorrect demo --scenario all

# Test payment protection:
agentcorrect demo --scenario stripe-missing

# Test SQL protection:
agentcorrect demo --scenario sql-unbounded

# Analyze your own agent logs:
agentcorrect analyze your-trace.jsonl
```
